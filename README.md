# Character-Controllers
These are a collection of the Unity Charecter controllers I have used and created over my time of game development in Unity.
The MouseLook.cs is for first person mouse movement.
The PlayerMovement.cs is for First person Movement in 3d Spaces.
I will (hopefully) post 2d character controllers soon.
